      A wedge is a simple machine that converts a force applied to its wide end into a splitting force at its narrow end, making it easier to separate or cut materials. It consists of two inclined planes joined together, forming a sharp edge that drives into materials. This concept has been used since ancient times; early examples include stone or metal wedges used by early humans for splitting wood or stone. The design of the wedge amplifies the force applied, allowing users to achieve tasks that would be difficult with direct force alone. Over the centuries, the basic principle of the wedge has been refined and applied in various tools and machinery, from axes and chisels to modern cutting equipment, proving its continued relevance and effectiveness in numerous applications.
